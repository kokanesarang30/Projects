"Hello everyone, this is YOUR Daily Dose of Internet. In this video, I show you the best of 2024 so far.

Links To Sources:"
Love the recap. I forgot about some of these gems.
I thought it was the end of the year for a second
"6:34 If that happened to me, I don't even think I could bring myself to be mad about it. That fish earned his freedom."
"9:23 got me dying for two reasons:
1. the bird was singing so happily
2. the way she was like SILENCE!!"
"I love the cop one so much. The officer yelling out ""There's a cop right next to you!"" Then the biker IMMEDIATELY tapping the helmet. That's comedy."
"That ""AMAZON"" was personal-
4:45"
9:19 the bird that caught a banger earworm that stuck in its head till the morning it had to get out. And now it can't be stopped. It's just too catchy.  Gets me every time
"1:34 If it wasn't filmed they would've been like ""uh huh suuuuure you fell"""
"Is it a coincidence that the best of 2024 came out the same day as the solar eclipse, a major 2024 event"
0:39 was a gold moment with that egg. Perfect placement and timing.
Istg I can't get over the mom telling her kid to use both his eyes  0:45
"7:55 shushes ""im having a convorsation"" dog: sings butifully"
2:23 ... That was the best oooooohhhmmmm I've ever heard. So zen.
I rewatch your old ones fairly regularly. So yes anything you put out we will watch. Keep up the good work brother
6:30 bro the dog is straight from hell
“Is that god?” Had me dying 2:02
"Yes please, Jason; more of these compilations every quarter year or so would be fab. Thank you"
"My mandarin teacher played this in class today and it was one of the first videos my class actually paid attention to and not completely talk over, I just wanna say thanks."
1:34 That baby really did just tell his dad to shut up.
"yes, defiantly keep the recaps coming! I found your channel years ago and I'm so very glad you're still making videos."
"3:58 He did not want to drive
(WHY IS THE WHIMPERING SO CUTE)"
You can tell it’s been a crazy year if daily dose is already doing this
"I love how in 3:20 when he fell, he just accepted his fate"
I've seen the clip several times before at 9:43 and could still see it over and over and over. Pure joy for sure!
"9:29 the bird really continued like saying ""I~ don care!"""
9:26 that Bird passed the vibe check
I've been in a horrible mood for no reason all day and nothing has been able to cheer me up except this. Thank you so much
4:36 AMAZON️
This channel ALWAYS lives up to expectations. NEVER has clickbait.  Great content.  Thank you!
7:40 I would vote for him.
1:43 that’s a terrible day if I’ve ever seen one
"If anyone didn’t know, cats practically don’t hunt rats. Their diet in the wild consists of small birds (tits, sparrows, pigeons, crows and the like) and small rodents (mostly mice). Rats can even grow to a size larger than cats and, as a rule, do not walk alone, plus they are very brave and vicious in front of their enemies, even if the size of the enemy is very much larger than their own. Cats do not hunt rats out of a good life, that is, only in cases when there is nothing else to eat."
5:32 Average episode of Tom and Jerry
"The Earth, Wind, and Fire whistling September is by far the BEST ALL YEAR.

That bird is getting it!!!!!!!"
7:45 that dog looks so proud
"2:41 ""There's a cop next to you"""
"2:35 my most favorite cip of this video!
Btw keep up whit your content, mate!   Love your videos <3"
6:40 I absolutely LOST it LMAOOO WHY DID IT DO THAT
7:56 that singing dog is literally me in the car all the time
"“Use both of your eyes” 
That cat needed to us both its ears 5:52"
7:47 he would definitely get my vote
The cardboard art is probably one of the most impressive thing I've ever seen
"the bird at 9:15 was whistling ""September"", by Earth, Wind & Fire. nice choice."
"0:36
That one got me dead, bro said, say less"
"4:23 ""Do not attempt"" Where the hell should I get a Fighter jet from !?"
7:09 Bro said sit when the dog was already sitting.
"9:53 I love how the dog is like: 
I did it! 
OMG i did it!
OMG did you see that!
That was amazing!"""
3:16 that trick was slick
"Thanks for the smile and laughs! And yes please, loving the build up. You have great videos, fun to re-watch in a compilation."
"4:09 “Yo what’s this box doing here?”

Press Shift to run"
"7:57
This definitely isn't a video from 2024, I distinctly remember seeing it a number of years ago.
Absolute gold though, I'll rewatch it any day."
That cardboard Art is amazing
"6:35  I love how the other dog looks like he’s asking for help
“he’s behind me isn’t he”
Something happened to the time stamp so the new one is 6:23"
The dog at 2:38 shows how fast a dog goes from happy to mad to sleepy in a matter of seconds
9:10 she's crying as if the bird assaulted her
It's always nice to have more of your fun in a longer row.
"Damnnnn the way that bear peeled around that corner and all I saw was eyes for a second. Shit, granny, I'm screaming too"
"3:09 He is trying to say ""Subscribe to DDOS and like the vids"""
8:22 sandman seem to be doing well since Spiderman 3
"The pug screaming like a human child killed me.

Okay, maybe something is wrong with me because the DoorDash guy screaming when he saw the cat cracked me up too. I guess screaming in fear is hilarious to me.

I'm not totally broken because the lady screaming at the bear did not make me laugh. Phew."
1:10 - the goat is his spirit animal.
"7:14 smart kid, already knew what was gonna happen"
"7:50 
girl:stop intrupting im having a conversation
dog: heavenly vocals"
"The boy, who fell from the stairs and push the alarm, LOL the shelf was like I am out of here  @ 1:40 min"
8:04 smol
9:55 hes so pround
"This is the best youtube channel for curiosities, by far. Thank you for the great stuff you select for us"
6:22 my anxiety killed me
"9:47 The dog really knew he could do it, so he d i d."
7:50 that dog got talent
"I support and like videos like this. I like reddit. but seeing the best of a year's worth of videos summarised here saves you a lot of time and effort.
Greetings from Germany"
"Yes, love the top montages, for sure. Would like to see more.  Thank you!"
"6:35
That dog is probably satan.."
"After chasing that eclipse all day, this was a great way to unwind, totally needed this today, thank you very much @ Daily Dose Of Internet."
7:41 That's the best picture of Biden I've seen in a long time.
7:45 that cat had speed like Sonic the Hedgehog
5:37 the cat and the mouse switched roles
"3:53 he isn’t on earth bro, he’s in space"
"9:31 yes talk to us as in get the fuck away lol
It’s their defence mechanisms if anyone wanted to know"
just in case if we don’t have a 2025
1:04 the scream
8:28 i love mankind
6:27 that's a demon dog
6:55 I wonder what it's like to be that talented.
The snoring one was so real! (1:29). Thanks for this!
this video healed me
The creativity that goes into cardboard art blows me away.  I can't begin to imagine how it's done. I love it!
"This is a brilliant compilation!  Thank you.  I always watch your vids, subbed about nine years ago,  vids are always good.  Well done."
6:50 ..... awesome art.
4:00 drivers anxiety
Seeing so much love here is beautiful. God bless you all!
"Really cool idea! If you decide to keep making this kind of videos, then they will be like a very concentrated delicious syrup - a compilation of best memes over the course of some time span, really nice. Also would like to use this comment (because I don't write as many of those) to communicate my immense appreciation for the quality of the haha-videos you find online - you are the only channel on YouTube whose every single compilation consists of exclusively amusing(and interesting) videos. Amazing work<3"
"Yes, I enjoyed it and would like to see more like this in the future! Thanks ️"
3:40 That plane is gonna head to Mars
Hilarious - just the dull sort of morning when I needed a really good laugh!  Thanks.
9:38 What bees say: go away.
"6:00 he looked hurt, emotionally"
That was really fun to watch. It would be great to get more of these Best-of-compilations!
These were great  Thanks for sharing!
"Fantastic! I rarely see your videos these days, don’t know why YouTube doesn’t suggest you, you’re always putting great content!"

"0:12
THE WAY THE DOG SCREAMED LIKE A HUMAN AT THE END KILLED ME"

Thank you for this. My Dad passed away a week ago and I have really needed a laugh.
"9:19 
This little man makes me happier than happy and I have no idea why

Great job on the video! It was both entertaining and educational.
"I liked this video! I like the length! Not too long. I like our short daily videos too! Great work, bringing us the best of the internal in a nutshell! Thanks for making them!!!"

"Thank you for sharing, great job. Know that the Light of your being is a blessing to everyone on your journey. Shine on"
"2:10 damn, that lat-drop is insane"
2:20 that cat definitly could be a great WWE wrestler with that takedown
2:57 fear unlocked: Tablecloths
One of your best collections. The poor guy with the glass table. He was being so careful and it shattered so completely. It didn't seem real. Also liked the woman getting attacked by the bed.
3:13 I have no clue what he's saying but I 100% agree.
9:55 - This reminded me of the Deepwater Horizon movie sort of
9:00 that guy doesn’t look human
8:18 brooo that’s sooo clean
"This was hilarious.  Yes please, more like this DDOI.  Thank you."
"That amazing Japanease art!! I was so close to visiting it one point myself. I had experience with modeling and in late 2015 I was in contact with Capcom about the facial likeness role of Leon for the Resident Evil 2 Remake. I failed to mention I also have a voice acting background, in the end I lost the part and I can't forgive myself for wasting such an opportunity to visit Japan..."
2:48 he knew he messed up
2:16 best ASMR ever
5:24 is the funniest shit I've seen all week. Thank you.
"9:05 reminds me of when my mom wanted a Caesar salad and the person said, 

""chicken sandwich?”"
1:47 to this day i still wonder why that thing in the front just took off
That dog won the trophy vocal arena 7:57
Wow 10:25 is so talented
3:34 I don’t know if yall heard that but I think that cat maniacally laughed
2:30 I think I've seen this clip the first time in 2009 lol

"0:18 Dog Scream

"Thanks for your great videos, we have been looking at them in class all year!! Keep up the good work! Regards Sweden 5C."
"Dont worry guys, DDOI has just finally become powerful enough to create his own calendar system where the new year starts in April.

2:00 the tone in which she said that is just priceless
I'll bet the guy a 7:04 is really good at Resident Evil
3:26 the life was just taken away from him
"8:55 This is how Machamp would punch, I'd imagine."
